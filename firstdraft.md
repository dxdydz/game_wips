# First Draft: A Word Game

## Equipment
- Money (poker chips or coins or similar)
- Letter tiles (eg Scrabble tiles)
- Ten coasters or cards marked with 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5 respectively
- Player board with two word spaces that could fit 1x9 letter tiles, as well as a circular "letter pool"

## Setup
1. Shuffle the coasters and lay out five in a line
2. Shuffle the letter tiles and place them on the coasters. There should be as many letter tiles as the number printed on the coaster.
3. Give each player 4 chips to start with, and a player board.

## Play

- Players take turns. On your turn you may sell any words you have formed, and then you must choose a coaster and place all the letters from the coaster on your board.
- 
### Selling a Word
- You may sell any valid, English words you have formed. These words must be in one or both of your word rows, and there can be no extraneous letters in the row. Words score points based on the length of the word, with longer words scoring more points per letter than shorter words. The scores are, in (length, score): (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 5), (7, 7), (8, 9), (9, 12). The score is received in the form of coins. These can be kept for points at the game end, or may be spent during the game to buy coasters further up the line.
- If you find yourself in a situation where you do not believe you can form a valid word from the letters in a word row, you may choose to discard all letters in a row during this phase of your turn. These letter tiles are removed from your board and placed face down next to it. They will be worth -1 point each at the end of the game.

### Choosing a Coaster
- You must select a coaster.
- The leftmost coaster in the line is free, but every coaster further along the line costs coins to choose. The coins are placed on the coasters you pass up, a la Small World. So if you want the 5th coaster, it will cost you $4, with $1 being added to each of the four coasters left of the fifth coaster.

### Placing Letters
- Once you've selected a coaster, you must immediately place the letters from the coaster on to your board, subject to the following constraints:
1. Letters can be placed in either word row or in your letter pool, provided there is space. Word rows may never have more than 9 litters, and the letter pool may never have more than 4 letters in it. (Remember: The letters within your letter pool can be added to a word row at any time. You may want to promote some of them to words to make room in the pool.)
2. Letters can be placed at any position within the letters of a word row. They can be at the start of the word, or the end of the word, or in the middle. However, **you may never re-arrange the letters within a word row**. Once they are placed, they are fixed in that order, though new letters can be inserted in between. For example, if your word row reads "SFT" and you grab an "O" and an "I" from a coaster; you may insert either the "O" or "I" to form "SOFT" or "SIFT", but you can not re-arrange the letters to form "FOIST".
3. Letters within the word pool have no order, and may be moved into words at any time, including during other players turns. Like all other letter tiles, once added to a word, letters from your pool may not be removed or re-arranged.
4. In the event that you wish to add letters to your letter pool, but you already have four tiles in the pool, you must discard letters from the letter pool until the total is down to four. These discarded letters are placed face down next to your player board and will count as -1 points at the end of the game.

### Upkeep
- The coaster you selected is moved to the discard pile. The other coasters in the line are moved up to fill the gap created by the selected coaster, and a new coaster tile is added to the end of the line. A number of letter tiles corresponding to the value of the new coaster is placed on it. Play rotates to the next player.

## Game End

- Play continues in this manner until there are insufficient letter tiles to fill a coaster. At this point, the game immediately ends. All players are allowed to score any unscored words in their word rows at this time. Players count their money, and then return to the bank $1 for every letter they have discarded face down next otheir player board during the course of the game. The player with the most money wins.




# [OLD RULES BELOW]

## Equipment

- Letter tiles with higher values for less frequent letters (BuyWord tiles or Scrabble Tiles, etc)
- Player board per player with spaces for a 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7- tile long word. (Easily hand drawn)
- Coasters equal to the number of players plus one
- Some kind of markers or coins
- Pen & paper for score keeping

## Play

Players take turns being the starting player.

The starting player draws 4 random letter tiles per empty coaster and places them on the coasters. 

Beginning with the starting player, each player drafts one coaster from the center of the table. The remaining coaster receives a token. This token is worth +2 points when the coaster is selected. A coaster can collect multiple bonus scoring tokens.

That player then needs to place every letter tile into one of the words on their player board. 

Letter tiles must be placed into an empty space and cannot be moved or rearranged once they are placed.

If, during the placement, a word has had all its spaces filled, that word is scored thusly:

- If it is not a valid dictionary word, the player receives -1 for every tile in the word. The tiles are discarded.
- If it is a valid dictionary, the player receives the sum of the values on the tiles plus the word bonus for longer words. The tiles are discarded.

Play continues until there are no more letter tiles.


## Unresolved questions

- Ideal total number and distribution of tiles; need to run further analysis on computer
- What to do with half-finished words at the end of the game?
- Need rigidly defined length of words, or could it be eg 3 of 10 or less?
-
