# First Draft: A Word Game

## Equipment

- Letter tiles with higher values for less frequent letters (BuyWord tiles or Scrabble Tiles, etc)
- Player board per player with spaces for a 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7- tile long word. (Easily hand drawn)
- Coasters equal to the number of players plus one
- Some kind of markers or coins
- Pen & paper for score keeping

## Play

Players take turns being the starting player.

The starting player draws 4 random letter tiles per empty coaster and places them on the coasters. 

Beginning with the starting player, each player drafts one coaster from the center of the table. The remaining coaster receives a token. This token is worth +2 points when the coaster is selected. A coaster can collect multiple bonus scoring tokens.

That player then needs to place every letter tile into one of the words on their player board. 

Letter tiles must be placed into an empty space and cannot be moved or rearranged once they are placed.

If, during the placement, a word has had all its spaces filled, that word is scored thusly:

- If it is not a valid dictionary word, the player receives -1 for every tile in the word. The tiles are discarded.
- If it is a valid dictionary, the player receives the sum of the values on the tiles plus the word bonus for longer words. The tiles are discarded.

Play continues until there are no more letter tiles.


## Unresolved questions

- Ideal total number and distribution of tiles; need to run further analysis on computer
- What to do with half-finished words at the end of the game?
- Need rigidly defined length of words, or could it be eg 3 of 10 or less?
-
