# Bid and Wager

*A "hand-pruning" trick taking game*

## Equipment

- Standard 52 card deck

## Setup

- Deal each player 11 (?) cards, and flip the top card of the deck to determine trump.
- Starting with eldest hand, players bid for the number of tricks they expect to win based on their hand. Players can bid from 1 to 10 tricks.
- Then, players make "wagers" for their bids. These wagers consist of cards discarded from their hand, and therefore may be at most 11 minus their bid (so if a player bid 4 tricks, they could wager as many as 7 cards). Wagers are removed from the player's hand and discarded. The player must now try to achieve their bid with their remaining hand. Players must wager at least 1 card. 
- Following bidding and waging, players play tricks. The eldest hand leads first. Players must follow if able. The player who played the highest trump, or if no trumps, the highest card following suit, wins the trick. A player must play in each trick if they still have cards.
- If a player is about to play their last card, they announce "out!" as they play their card. This is important to determine the leader of the subsequent trick, if there is one. The leader for the following trick is the player who won the trick, if they still have cards, otherwise it defaults to the player who played the strongest card who still has cards.
- If a player achieves their bid, they receive points equal to their bid times their wager. eg, a player who bid 4 and wagered 3 would receive 12 points.
