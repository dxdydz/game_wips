# Blop?

A game of repulsion inspired by Blam! and Boop. Blam! + Boop. = Blop?

## Equipment

- 6x6 Square Grid
- 3 trios each in two player colors

## Setup

Each player takes the three trios in their color. This is henceforth referred to as theirh and.

## Play

Play alternates in turns. On your turn, you:

- Play one of the pieces in your hand to an unoccupied square on the board.
- The played piece must push as many adjacent pieces away as possible
  - Large pieces push 3 adjacent pieces away, medium pieces push 2 adjacent pieces, and small pieces can push only one piece
  - Pushed pieces are pushed one space away from the placed piece. Both orthogonal and diagonally adjacent pieces are pushed.
  - Pushed pieces do not "chain reaction" - you can not push an adjacent piece into a space that is occupied by another piece. If this would occur, you must choose a different adjacent piece to push, if able.
  - Pieces that are pushed off the edge of the board are collected by the active player and added to their hand, even if they are the opponent's color. They can be played on subsequent turns.
 
If a player has no pieces in their hand, they must pass.

## Game End

Play continues until one player wins by 3-in-a-row or until both players pass. If, at the end of their turn, a player has three adjacent pieces of their color in a row (diagonally, horizontally, or vertically) on the board, they win. If the game ends by passing, whichever player passes last is the winner.
