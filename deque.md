# Deque (of Cards)

*A game for 3-5 using a standard deck of cards. The hook is that you can only play cards from the ends of your hand and may not rearrange your hand.*

- Game is played over multiple rounds
- Shuffle and deal out 10 cards to each player. **Players may NEVER re-arrange their cards.** They *can* fan them to the left or right as their preference dictates, but the order of the cards must not change.
- Flip the top card of the deck over to determine trump
- Eldest hand starts bidding. Players must bid at least 1 trick (and may bid up to 10).
- When leading, the player must play either the leftmost or rightmost card in their hand.
- Following players, if they have a matching suit on the left or right of their hand, must play that card. If they have no matching suit, they can choose to either:
  - Play a card from another suit (including the trump suit) that is in the leftmost or rightmost position in their hand, or
  - Discard cards from either the left or right side of their hand until they hit a card that follows suit. You choose a side (either from the left, going right; or from the right, moving left) and discard cards one by one until you hit the first card that matches suit. You then must play that card. In the event that you have no cards which match suit, you discard all but the final card, which you then play. Only a card in the suit that was lead will stop the discarding.
- If a player is playing the last card of their hand, they announce to the table "out!"
- If only one player remains, they win all subsequent tricks.
- Players receive points for each trick won (tokens are useful, since tricks vary in size), as well as a **10 point bonus** should they happen to achieve their bid target. There is no penalty for failing to meet your bid, but you do not receive any bonus.
