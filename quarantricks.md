# Quarantricks

Four player sickness avoidance game

5 suits, 4 normal and a 5th "virus" suit (different back, clearly marked)

Play is somewhat like Hearts

## Setup

Deal 13 cards to each player. Shuffle the virus suit and place the "patient zero" card in the middle. The winner of the first trick will be patient 0.

If you win a trick that contains a virus card, you must discard a card from your hand and draw a card from the virus suit deck.

Virus suit can only be played if you can't otherwise follow. Virus cards in your collected tricks count negative points.
