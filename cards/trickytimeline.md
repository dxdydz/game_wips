# Tricky Timeline
*A trick-taking game for two where players don't play to tricks in order*

## Setup
- Gather 2-8 in all four suits. These will form the deck.
- Find the Ace of Spades and set it aside.
- Take nine other cards and place them face down in a line between the two players. These are used as markers to represent a timeline of the nine tricks of the hand. Their values do not matter.
- Place the Ace of Spades at one end of the timeline of face down cards, rotated so that the Spade symbol looks like an arrow pointing along the line of face down cards. This will be a reminder of the order in which tricks are resolved, starting from the trick nearest to the Ace of Spades and progressing down the line.
- Choose a starting player randomly

## Deal
Shuffle the deck (the 2-8 cards) and deal four cards face down. Set these aside (they will not be used in this hand), and deal the remaining 24 cards out to each player equally.

## Play
The starting player chooses one card from their hand and plays it to their side of any of the nine tricks. From there, play alternates between both players, each playing a single card to a trick, subject to the following placement restrictions:
1. No single player can ever play more than one card to any trick.
2. If your opponent has already played a card to their side of a trick, and you wish to play to that trick, you must match suit (if able). If you are unable to match suit, you may play any card. Note: Although you must match suit when playing to a trick, you are not required to play to any particular trick if you have other options still open.
3. You may never play to the same trick as your opponent just played to, if you have any other trick available.

Play continues in this fashion until both players have played a card to each of the 9 tricks. At this point, the players will have three cards remaining in their hand, which represent their bid.

### Resolving Tricks, Scoring, and Bids
The remaining three cards in each player's hand represents their bid for the hand, the number of tricks they expect to take. The suits of these three cards determine how many tricks each card is worth. A diamond card represents 0 tricks, spades 1, hearts 2, and clubs 3 tricks. So if your three cards are all clubs, that represents a bid of 9 tricks. Likewise, if you have a heart, a diamond, and a spade, that would be a bid of 2 + 0 + 1 = 3 tricks.

Resolve the tricks along the line between each players. Start at the end of the line closest to the Ace of Spades. Determine the winner of the first trick as though the starting player had lead to that trick. Whoever played a higher card in the suit led wins that trick. Move the face down marker card on top of the winner's card to indicate their success. Move down the line to the next trick, with the leading player being whoever won the previous trick, so on and so forth.

Compare tricks won to the player's bid cards. Whichever player had a closer bid to their actual tricks taken, wins the round (eg, if Anna bid 3 and won 4, and Bran bid 8 and won 5, Anna would win the round for being only 1 trick away from her target). If both players are tied, the player who took fewer tricks wins the round.

## Game End
The first player to win 2 rounds, wins.
