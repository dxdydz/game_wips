# He Will Never Stop
*Horror movie inspired solitaire played mostly in the hand*

## Conceit
You are a final girl being chased by Him. If He ever catches you, you will die. The cards represent objects and terrain. Cards in your hand are what is between you and Him, cards in the draw pile are terrain you have yet to see, and cards in the discard are terrain that both you and Him have already passed by.

## Material

- A-8 in four suits from a standard deck of playing cards. The aces are 1s.

## Setup

Shuffle the deck and place it to your right. Deal yourself a hand of 8 cards, but do not re-organize them in any way.

## Play

Every turn, including the first, two things happen: First, He pursues you, and second, you take one action.

### He Pursues You

Discard the left-most card from your hand. If that card was part of a sequence of 3 or more cards, keep discarding cards until there is no longer a sequence of 3 or more. For example, if your hand was 3-4-5-6-2-7-3, the 3 and 4 would both be discarded, leaving 5-6-2-7-3.

### Take One Action

Choose one of two actions: Search, or Try to Escape

- **Search**: *You look around your surroundings to try to find some way to stop Him, but all the while He still gets closer*. Discard all cards of a single rank from your hand, and draw as many new cards as you discarded. New cards are always added to the right side of your hand. For example, if your hand was 2-5-3-9-6-3-4, you could discard both 3s and draw two new cards to replace them, ending up perhaps with 2-5-9-6-4-5-7 where 5 and 7 are the two new cards.

- **Try to Escape**: *You move some obstacles to get away faster, but your efforts will also aid Him once he reaches the same place.* Move one card in your hand to a new location within your hand. The chosen card may not be part of a sequence of 3 or more cards (eg, 3-4-5). If, by moving this card, you cause a new sequence to form, or lengethen an existing sequence, draw 2 new cards and add them to the right side of your hand. For example, if your hand was 2-3-4-7-3-4-6-5, you could move the 5 so that your hand was 2-3-4-5-7-3-6, lengthening the existing 2-3-4 sequence and drawing 2 new cards.

## Game End

The game ends in one of three ways:

- **He catches you**. If your hand is ever empty, He has caught you. You die.

- **Construct a Trap to Destroy Him**. If you ever hold 4 cards of the same rank in your hand, next to each other, you have constructed a trap that will destroy Him. You immediately win.

- **You escape ...for now**. If you successfully exhaust the draw deck without Him catching you, you have managed to escape. He is still out there, but you are safe for now.
