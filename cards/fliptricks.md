# Flip Tricks
*Card flipping trick-taking game for four radical players*

## Equipment  
- 2-10 in four suits

## Play
Shuffle and deal a hand of 8 cards to each player. Choose a player to be the first leader.

Lead player plays a card and all other players must follow suit, if able. Lowest in-suit card played to the trick wins the trick IF AND ONLY IF that player is able to complete the flip trick. If that player fails to nail the flip trick, the next lowest player attempts the flip trick. So and on and so forth until one player successfully executes their trick or all players have failed. If all players have failed, the player with the highest rank wins the trick.

### Flip Trick

The player attempting the flip trick must place their card so it is hanging over the edge of the table, face down. They must then, with two fingers, flip the card up and onto the table, such that it lands face up with their two fingers pushing down on it. Their two fingers must be partially or wholly on two pips of the card. 
(This is easier to do with a higher rank card, that has more pips. Players may want to try this a couple times to get the knack for it before starting the first hand.)

## Score

Players score for the sum of the face values in their trick pile.
