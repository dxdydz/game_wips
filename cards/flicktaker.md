# Flick Taker
*Partnership trick-taking flicking game for four players*

## Idea
The game is played similarly to Squails or Push It but with a partnership trick taking game bolted on top. You will seek to have your team be closer to the target than the other team, but you have to follow suit and can trump. Additionally, some crokinole pieces (those corresponding to the face cards) will be worth more points to capture.

## Materials
2 crokinole discs in two colors, or 1 disc in four colors (4 discs total)
Playing cards: 5 number cards + 1 face card in each of four suits, +an equal distribution of other cards in the four suits (to determine trump)
1 target, ideally this is fairly hefty and a little bit smaller than the crokinole discs
A table, ideally square or circular

## Setup
- Agree to a points goal that you will play to. 50 points is good for a short game, while 100 makes for a longer game.
- Place the target in the middle of the table
- Seat players so that they are all approximately equidistant from the target (on a square table, each sat on one side). Partners should be sat opposite each other, such that play alternates between teams.
- Give each player one crokinole disc of their team's color (or their own color)
- Shuffle the playing cards and deal 6 face down to each player.
- Using the cards set aside, flip over the top card. The suit of this card indicates trump for the round.
- Randomly choose a starting player. This player will lead the first trick.

## Play
- The leading player will choose a card from their hand to play. The suit of the card determines the suit all other players must play, if able. The player then places a disc on the edge of the table and flips it toward the target, aiming to stop their disc as near as possible to the target.
- Play proceeds clockwise around the table. Each player must play a card that matches suit, if able, and then flicks a disc toward the target. If a player does not having cards that match suit, they may play another card, including a card of the trump suit.
- Once all four players have played a card and flicked a disc, determine the winner of the trick. The player with who played a trump card and is closest to the target wins the trick, otherwise the player who is closest to the target in the suit that was lead (if not trump) wins the trick. The winner of the trick collects the cards and places them face down in their win pile. The winner will lead the next trick. All players retrieve their discs for the next hand.

## End of Round
After six tricks, the hand is over and players score their won tricks. Every card in their win pile is worth 1 point, except the face cards which are each worth 3 points. Add the sum of each team's score to their existing score (from previous rounds). If any team has passed the points goal for the game, they win! Otherwise, collect the card, re-set the flicking target, flip a new trump suit, and deal out a new hand.

### Some Fiddly Details
- If anyone, as a result of their flick, causes any pieces to fly off of the table, that team immediately loses the trick. If one of the pieces that left the table was the target, replace the target in the center of the table.
- If during the course of play, a player disc causes the target to move (but remain on the table), play continues with the target in the new position for the remainder of the trick. It is reset in the middle for the next trick.
