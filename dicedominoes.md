# Dice Dominoes

*A twist on classic connection-style dominoes where dice stand in for the dominoes*

## Equipment

- A shedload of d6s (30-42 depending on player count -- 10-14 per player, plus 2 more)
- Player screens

## Setup

If playing 3 or 4 player, give each player 10 dice. If playing 2 player, each player receives 14 dice. If you have the dice for it, it is nice to give each player dice of a single color distinct from all other players.

For the first round, the starting player is chosen randomly. On subsequent rounds, it will be the player who won the previous round.

## Play

Every player rolls their dice behind their screen. Two neutral dice are rolled and placed in the center of the table as the starting "domino".

From there, players alternate turns. On your turn, you choose two of your dice to add to an end of the domino train, if possible. One of the dice must match the value of the die at the end you are adding to. If the two dice you are playing have the same value, you play them orthogonally to the line of play; otherwise the dominoes are placed in line. If you have no dice which match either end of the train, you are blocked, and play passes to the next player.

Play continues in this manner until one player has played all their dice, or all players become blocked. At this point, the round ends and points are tallied. If one player played all their dice, they receive the sum of the pips from all other players' unplayed dice. If all players were blocked, the player with the lowest sum of pips among their unplayed dice receives the sum of all other players' unplayed dice.

## Game End

Game ends immediately when one player crosses a pre-agreed threshold number of points, such as 50.
