# Greater Good

Game for two players and one set of double six dominoes.

## Setup

Shuffle the dominoes face down into a boneyard. Deal 10 dominoes to each player and one face-up to the middle of the table. 

## Play

On a player's turn, if able, they must play a domino to the center subject to the following restrictions:
* The domino must touch at least one other domino
* Each half of the domino must be greater or equal to every other domino half it touches. 
* Dominoes may be placed on top of another domino (or dominoes). Overhangs are not allowed. The placed domino values must be greater or equal to the values it is covering up, as specified in the previous rule.
* The dominoes played may never exceed 4 squares in either direction (Everything must be contained within a 4x4 grid, where the grid squares are half of a domino. Where exactly this boundary lay is determined during the first moves of the round.)

If you are unable to place a domino, you draw one domino and play passes to the other player.

If there are no more dominoes in the boneyard, your turn is passed.

If both players pass, or one player has played all their dominoes, the round ends.

## End of Round

If one player played all their dominoes, they score the sum of all pips still in the hand of the other player.

If both players passed, compare pip counts remaining in the players' hands. The player with the lower sum receives the other player's sum as points.

The winning player plays first in the subsequent round.

## Game End

Play continues until one player has passed a pre-determined threshold of points, such as 50 points.
