### Clock

Place markers and pawns in a circle. Maybe in a pattern like m p m m p m m m p... Place one special piece in circle

On turn player tosses d8. On the first turn only, player chooses whether to go clockwise or counter-clockwise. The player then moves the special piece that number of spaces and takes the piece they land on. If it's a marker, they get to go again, if it's a pawn, their turn is over.

On subsequent turns, players may choose to freeze d2s from their existing d8 toss. These d2s can never be unfrozen again for the duration of the turn, and players must always throw at least one d2. 

Play continues until a player gets N markers, that player is the winner.
