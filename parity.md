# Parity

Classic domino game. One player scores odds and one scores evens.

Whichever player plays first in a round is odds. Every time the sum of the ends of the chain is odd, that player scores that sum as points. Every time it's even, the other player scores that sum. It does not matter whose turn it is for scoring purposes.
