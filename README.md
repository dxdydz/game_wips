# Game Design Works-in-Progress

Catch-all repo for half-finished and unpublished game rules

## Looney Pyramid Games

- [Blop?](blop.md): 2 Player abstract inspired by Blam! and Boop.
- [Domizone](domizone.md): Game played with dominos and icehouse pieces
- [Cap-less Volcano Variant](nocapvolcano.md): Variant of Volcano that tries to remove the cap-movement puzzle as well as other changes.

## Domino Games

- [Greater Good](greatergood.md): Stacking domino game
- [Bone Rails](bonetrack.md): Pick up and deliver with domino tracks and dice passengers.
- [Parity](parity.md): Classic domino game in the style of Muggins or All Fives except one player scores every time the line is odd and the other every time it is even.
- [Dice Dominoes](dicedominoes.md): Block Dominoes except you play with a bunch of dice.
- [Trolley](trolley.md): Straightforward must-not-follow trick-taking game for four players, using double 6 dominoes.

## Standard Deck Card Games

- [Deque of Cards](deque.md): The hand as a double ended queue
- [Bid & Wager](bidandwager.md): Hand pruning, trick-taking game where you back up your bid with a wager of cards pruned from your hand
- [Quarantricks](quarantricks.md): Hearts-like point-avoidance game where the bad suit is infectious

## Other Games

- [First Draft](firstdraft.md): Letter-drafting word-building game. Think Azul meets Wordle, but using Scrabble tiles.
- [Found Game](found_game.md): Game system designed to be easily constructable from objects in your local environment (rocks, twigs, bottle caps, etc.)
