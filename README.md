# Game Design Works-in-Progress

Catch-all repo for half-finished and unpublished game rules

## Looney Pyramid Games

- [Blop?](blop.md): 2 Player abstract inspired by Blam! and Boop.
- [Domizone](domizone.md): Game played with dominos and icehouse pieces
- [Cap-less Volcano Variant](nocapvolcano.md): Variant of Volcano that tries to remove the cap-movement puzzle as well as other changes.

## Other Games

- [First Draft](firstdraft.md): Letter-drafting word-building game. Think Azul meets Wordle, but using Scrabble tiles.
