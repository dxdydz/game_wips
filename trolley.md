# Trolley
*Must-not-follow trick-taking domino game for four players*

## Equipment

1 double six domino set

## Setup

Shuffle the dominoes and deal 7 to each player. The first player is determined randomly.

## Play

Play progresses clockwise from the leader. Players must play a domino to the center of the table oriented such that one value is facing them and one value is pointing in toward the center of the table. Players may not play any domino that has the same value pointing into the center as any other previously played domino. If a player is unable to play, they simply do not play. The player with the highest scoring domino wins the trick.

### Domino Scoring

Dominoes are scored based on the value of the the outer square of the domino. In a case of a tie, the lower valued inner domino wins. Double dominoes are trumps, with the blank-blank being the most powerful trump.
