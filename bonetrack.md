# Bone Track (working title)

Very loose idea for now, but the conceit is to use dominoes for building track in a pick up and deliver style game. Game board a grid, dominoes get played with matching ends to create track between stations. Passengers/goods may be represented as dice, with the pip-count reflecting their destination stations.

Perhaps there are various actions you can take, and the total of the ends of the track you played to determine what you do. For example, play to a track and make a multiple of 5 on the ends of that track, you can deliver a passenger. Maybe that's unwieldy.

Probably need a good size board and many dominoes (maybe multiple double 6 sets?) to have the geometry be at all interesting
