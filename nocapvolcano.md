# Cap-less Volcano (better name TBD)

An attempt to resolve two perceived issues with Volcano/Caldera as it stands now:
- Volcano caps add little to the game except busy work. Standard 5x5 volcano allows for eruption of any volcano in the majority of board positions.
- The fact that smalls are hidden under a medium and a large means they are the hardest piece to get and the game becomes a game of trying to deny your opponent any chances to collect smalls. This is especially so with the Caldera win conditions.

## Board Setup Change

An alternative setup that results in smalls being more available. Mediums become the hot commodity, but they are still easier to get than smalls in the normal game.

    T = Tree
    N = Nest
    
    N T N T N
    T N T N T
    N T   T N
    T N T N T
    N T N T N

Colors TBD, but probably similar to existing layout

## Cap Change

Un-decided. Three options currently:

### No caps, erupt whatever

Choose a stack and erupt it for as far you'd like. Lack of a cap means that the adjacent stack will be the first to be hit. All other rules remain the same. *It seems like this might be too easy to get pieces in. Could require a harder end game condition than standard Caldera.*

### Power-play as cap

Suggestion from `hoembla`: if you have collected any pieces, on your turn you must place one of them on any stack and then erupt that stack. *Tidily solves the issue of collecting pieces too easy. I like the push-pull of whether to always try to get your power play piece back or sometimes choose to essentially swap it for a piece you want more. Could potentially address any second player advantage by giving a player a piece to start with. Also preserves the Volcano spacing (cap then erupted pieces) which makes it easier to swap back and forth with normal Volcano.*

### Caps on the outside

Two caps that move around the outside of the game board (like Mr. Jack Pocket). On your turn, move one cap to any other row/column/diagonal, and erupt the volcano intersected by the two lines. Potentially returns some of the "idea" of caps: the ability to restrict your opponent's options. In this version, your opponent will only ever be able to erupt one of the 9 spaces described by where you left the two caps. On the other hand, is restricting options good? This also introduces the need for additional pieces which going cap-less removed, though coins or any other suitable marker could be used in this case. *Untested*.
